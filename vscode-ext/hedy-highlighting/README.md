# Hedy highlighting

## About Hedy

[Hedy](https://www.hedy.org/) is a gradual programming language aimed at teaching programming and teaching Python. It
teaches using different levels. The first level just offers printing text and asking for input. This level is meant to
introduce learners to the idea of a programming language, and the environment. From there, Hedy builds up to include
more complex syntax and additional concepts.

Hedy is maintained by the Hedy Foundation (Stichting Hedy).

This extension is maintained by aniollidon who is not related with Hedy team apart from a great admiration for the work
they have done.
